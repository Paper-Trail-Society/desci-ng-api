Okunlola Timileyin Folasade,timileyinokunlola@gmail.com,The Use of Narrative Techniques in Playwriting,"Narrative technique is an essential aspect of playwriting and this research discusses its usage in playwriting. Various playwrights use different narrative techniques to suit their working styles. Some writers however make use of more than one technique in the process of writing. This study uncovers that the choice of a narrative technique determines the way the audience will relate with the play. A good choice helps the audience to feel among the production. They are swiftly carried along with the players as an essential part of the production themselves. This study therefore employs analytical method in order to critically examine the usage of narrative techniques in the play text. This is expounded in great details through scholarly opinions and the selected playtext being considered. The analytical method of research is analyzed through personal knowledge, understanding and opinions of various scholars about the usage of narrative techniques. This study draws largely from relevant articles, ebooks and journals which serves as the secondary sources. This study also dwells on “All for God” by Abdullahi Abubakar which would serve as the primary source. It therefore recommends that playwrights should make more use of these techniques so as to have a more engaging audience and also ensure that the techniques are used in the right way that best suits their production concept.","Relevant for Nigeria’s rich theatre tradition (e.g., Yoruba travelling theatre, Nollywood stage adaptations).

Ojo Paul Ouwatimilehin,ojopaul33@gmail.com,MARXIST AESTHETICS IN FEMI OSOFISAN’S MOROUNTODUN AND FAREWELL TO A CANNIBAL RAGE,"This study examines Marxist aesthetics in Femi Osofisan’s Morountodun and Farewell to a Cannibal Rage by exploring the society's intricacies and the imbalance apparent. It is a
common misconception that art is merely a means of expressing emotion. While this is not totally untrue, it is important to remember that art allows us to comment on a wide range of political and social events as well as to record history and represent societal values. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that literature is a product of society, as it is a form of art. As Aristotle says, literature is mimesis. Plato and Aristotle spoke of mimesis as the re-presentation of nature. This idea is what bolsters Tyson’s opinion that “Literature is a product of the socio-economic and hence ideological conditions of the time and place in which it was written, whether or not the author intended it or not” (63). This notion guides one to acknowledge the fact that literary works echo the milieu in which they were written. The society, as portrayed in literature, reveals the different facets of the common man's life. It reveals what people thought during a particular time and how they thought about it. It allows the individual to understand how a society functions and why it functions that way. With an individual reading of literary texts, we can detect the representation of the struggle of poor masses against the oppression of the rich. Thus, this project will attempt to study the Marxist concept of revolution as an expression of political and social consciousness in Femi Osofisan’s Morountodun and Farewell to a Cannibal Rage.","Directly tied to Nigerian socio-political struggles and class inequalities.

Harrison Obiefule ,Obiefuleharrison@gmail.com,"Blockchain, Cybersecurity, and State Sovereignty: Emerging Models for Nigeria’s Digital Future","Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country and largest digital economy, stands at a critical juncture in its pursuit of technological advancement, secure governance, and digital sovereignty. As cyber threats intensify and digital dependency on foreign platforms increases, the Nigerian state must reassess its approach to protecting its data, citizens, and national interests in cyberspace. This paper examines the role of blockchain technology in enhancing Nigeria’s cybersecurity architecture and reinforcing its digital sovereignty. Blockchain technology’s decentralised and tamper-proof nature offers new models for securing national databases, protecting digital identities, and restoring public trust in governance. Through the lens of political science and digital policy, this study examines the potential of blockchain to transform Nigeria’s governance systems, particularly in areas such as voter registration, land documentation, digital identification (e.g. NIN), and public service delivery. The paper critically analyses existing government initiatives, such as the National Blockchain Policy (2023), and identifies the institutional and infrastructural gaps that impede implementation. It also draws on comparative insights from other African countries deploying blockchain in governance to highlight regional trends and possibilities. Ultimately, the study argues that blockchain adoption must be rooted in Nigerian realities, addressing issues of digital literacy, local content development, and data localisation, while fostering collaboration between government, academia, and the private sector. If strategically embraced, blockchain can serve as a powerful tool not only for technological innovation but also for asserting Nigeria’s sovereignty and securing its digital future in an increasingly globalised world.

Okoye Anaetochukwu Vincent,netox3moon@gmail.com,The Effects of Cryptocurrency Trading on the Nigerian Economy (GDP),"This study investigated the influence of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain technology on financial intermediation and economic perceptions in Nigeria. Using a survey approach, the research gathered perspectives from various demographic groups. The findings suggested that DeFi platforms hold considerable potential to diminish dependence on traditional financial intermediaries, although obstacles such as insufficient awareness and security risks were prominent. Cryptocurrencies were recognized for their financial advantages, with many respondents reporting improvements in their financial status. Blockchain technology emerged as a key innovation with significant potential to improve payment systems. The study further highlighted demographic trends in cryptocurrency trading, showing that younger, wealthier, and more educated individuals were more actively involved. These results support theoretical models that emphasize the role of perceived usefulness and ease of use in the adoption of new technologies. The research recognizes the importance of public awareness campaigns, wellstructured regulations, security measures, and inclusive strategies to overcome challenges and optimize the benefits of these technologies. Addressing these issues could enable Nigeria to drive innovation and achieve widespread adoption of DeFi, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain technology and economical growth.","Contextually relevant to Nigeria’s crypto adoption (highest in Africa), youth-driven trading culture, and CBN’s attempts to regulate.

Anshuman Singh,anshuman@push.org,Hyvmind: A Research to Earn dApp for Tokenising Annotation,"While the superiority of language models over traditional search-engines has become clear in recent years, their ‘generativity’ remains a serious concern for policymakers. On the input side, it is generally acknowledged that most large models are trained on unethically sourced data. And on the output side, their tendency to hallucinate and misinform makes them unfit for domain-specific work. This paper takes the view that explainability and transparency cannot be achieved simply by putting ‘a human in the loop’. Taking legal work as a concrete site, it proposes Hyvmind – an architecture that puts ‘humans in the centre’ by recording and rewarding semantic labour through tokenised annotations. Its novelty lies in conceptualising legal research as a set of four
interconnected functions (source, watch, frame and curate) around a common data-object (source-text). By storing and rewarding annotative-work through a distributed ledger system with nested states, it creates a secure, ethical and organic pathway for generating high-quality datasets for the next generation of domain-specific language models.","Relevant in Nigerian context where legal/judicial systems struggle with digitization.

While many approaches have implemented either Internet of Things or machine learning algorithms, few studies have employed both. This project aims to predict cardiovascular disease by classifying it into two or three risk levels based on the vital parameters used. The proposed system, CardioPredictor was developed using an Arduino UNO R4
WiFi, MAX30102 pulse oximeter sensor, OLED display, dot board, AD8232 ECG module, and connecting wires. Electrocardiogram data was collected from Kaggle. Model training was performed using seven algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Kernel Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Linear Discriminant, K Nearest Neighbour, Multilayer Perceptron and Xgboost algorithm). Model evaluation was performed using accuracy, precision, recall and f1 score. The best model, XGBoost was deployed into CardioPredictor using coder in Matlab environment. The results obtained in this study were above 90 percent. However, XGBoost outperformed the other six models with an accuracy of 99.9 percent. Despite CardioPredictor's many advantages, the following changes might be made to make it even better. Real-world or other relevant ECG data should be used.

Bacteriophage therapy (PT) offers a targeted alternative; however, its clinical efficacy, safety, and potential outbreak mitigation remain underexplored. This narrative review synthesized evidence from 30 clinical studies to evaluate PT for ESKAPE infections. Complete bacterial clearance was achieved in 10 studies, primarily for P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae, with clinical improvement in 24 studies, including complex cases like osteomyelitis and cystic fibrosis-related pneumonia. PT was safe, with no serious adverse effects across 25 studies; mild, transient events (e.g., fever) were rare. Mortality, reported in nine studies, was unrelated to PT. One study demonstrated a reduction in nosocomial transmission of A. baumannii using environmental phages, suggesting a potential for outbreak control. PT shows promise as a safe, effective adjunct for MDR infections, but larger trials and standardized protocols are needed to address resistance, optimize dosing, and explore public health applications.

Chicken feathers have 92% keratin that can be a good source of peptides, amino acids, and minerals. This study is aimed at the bioconversion of poultry feather waste into a nutrient-rich feather hydrolysate and its application as a sustainable biofertilizer for watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) cultivation to develop an eco-friendly and efficient method to manage poultry feather waste while enhancing watermelon growth and yield through sustainable agricultural practices. The bioconversion process involved microbial hydrolysis using keratinolytic bacteria (Aqaumicrobium defluvii) collected from the microbial bank in Laboratory of Industrial Microbiology and Nanobiotechnology, LAUTECH, Ogbomosho to break down feathers into a bioavailable form. The selected bacteria were isolated and cultured, and feather waste was treated under optimal conditions for keratin degradation, producing a feather hydrolysate rich in nitrogen, amino acids, and micronutrients essential for plant growth. The resulting feather hydrolysate was then applied to watermelon crops in a controlled field trial, comparing its effects to conventional chemical fertilizer(NPK) and untreated controls. The results showed that the effectiveness of biofertilizers derived from feather and hoof hydrolysates on watermelon yield, while the biofertilizers did not significantly outperform conventional NPK fertilizer or water, they exhibited promising potential. However, factors such as nutrient concentration, application timing, and environmental conditions may have influenced the results.

Sylvester Agose,sylvesteragose@gmail.com,The Case for Space Education in Nigerian Universities,"This report presents a compelling case for the urgent and strategic integration of space education into Nigerian universities. Despite Nigeria's long-standing ambitions in space science and technology, a critical disconnect persists between these national goals and the educational pipeline required to support them. The global space economy is experiencing unprecedented growth, valued at over $546 billion in 2023 and projected to reach $1 trillion by 2030, with the private sector driving a significant portion of this expansion. Nigeria stands to gain substantially, with its space economy capable of contributing at least $1 billion annually to its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by the late
2020s. This document highlights existing challenges such as curriculum rigidity, faculty shortages, and insufficient infrastructure, which are often exacerbated by broader systemic issues in science education. However, it also showcases promising models, including pioneering university-led satellite projects like the Federal University of Technology, Akure's (FUTA) NigeriaEduSat-1 and its globally recognized CanSat team, the specialized postgraduate programs at the Institute of Space Science and Engineering (ISSE), and vibrant grassroots initiatives like Space Clubs Lagos State University (LASU). Drawing lessons from successful international programs in India, the United States, South Africa, and Brazil, a phased roadmap of actionable solutions is proposed. These interventions, spanning short-, medium-, and long-term horizons, include introducing foundational space science courses, targeted faculty development, establishing innovation hubs, developing formal degree programs, and institutionalizing student-led satellite missions. The objective is to spur collaboration among policymakers, university administrators, the National Space Research and Development Agency (NASRDA), and development partners to build an educational system that prepares Nigerian students for active participation in the global space industry. This transformation will foster innovation, strengthen Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education, boost national development, and mitigate brain drain.

Emmanuel Adebare Ayoade,ayoadeemmanueladebare1@gmail.com,Removal of Bisphenol A (BPA) from aqueous solution using Cu-Ni nanohybrid synthesised from Cassia siamea,"Bisphenol A (BPA), a widely used industrial chemical, poses significant environmental
and health risks due to its persistence and endocrine-disrupting properties. This study
presents a green synthesis approach for copper-nickel (Cu-Ni) nanohybrids using Cassia
siamea leaf extract, aimed at efficient BPA removal from aqueous solutions. The phytochemicals in Cassia siamea served as natural reducing and stabilizing agents,
enabling eco-friendly nanohybrids without toxic reagents. Characterization of the nanohybrids via FTIR, SEM, XRD, and UV-Vis spectroscopy confirmed their structural integrity and suitability for adsorption applications. Batch adsorption experiments were conducted to assess the influence of BPA concentration, contact time, pH, adsorbent dosage, and temperature. Optimal removal was achieved at 60 ppm BPA concentration, pH 6–7, 4 hours contact time, 0.04 g dosage, and 60°C temperature. Adsorption isotherm modeling revealed that the Langmuir model best described the process, indicating monolayer adsorption on a homogeneous surface. Freundlich and Temkin models also provided insights into multilayer interactions and adsorption energetics. Post-adsorption analysis confirmed strong binding between BPA molecules and the nanohybrid surface. The results demonstrate that Cassia siamea-derived Cu-Ni nanohybrids are a promising, sustainable, and cost-effective material for BPA remediation. This work contributes to the development of green nanotechnology for environmental purification and offers scalable solutions for water treatment in resource-limited regions.

Adekunle Daniel Prayer ,adekunledaniel114@gmail.com,"Determinant of voter behavior at the student Hall of Residence election in University of Ibadan, Nigeria.","This study investigated the determinants of voter behavior in students' halls of residence elections, employing a quantitative methodology to analyze the factors influencing electoral participation and candidate preference with Independence Hall as the case study of a student residential community at the University of Ibadan. This study seeks to understand the relative importance of individual characteristics, hall environment, and candidate-related factors in shaping student voting decisions. Data was collected through questionnaires administered to 150 resident students of Independence Hall, gathering information on demographics, political awareness, social integration, perceptions of hall government, and evaluations of candidates. The key findings revealed a complex interplay of factors influencing student electoral behavior. The research demonstrated a surprisingly weak correlation between general political awareness and actual participation in hall elections. While a significant proportion of students exhibit high levels of political knowledge and engagement with political issues regarding the hall of residence, this awareness does not necessarily translate into voting in hall elections. This suggests a disconnect between broader political consciousness and the perceived relevance or importance of hall-level governance. The study identified a strong positive association between the political atmosphere of the hall and voter turnout. Halls characterized by active political discourse, visible campaigning, and a sense of collective identity tend to exhibit higher rates of electoral participation. This finding underscores the importance of
social context and peer influence in shaping student political behavior. The presence of strong social networks and a culture that values political engagement appears to be a critical factor in mobilizing student voters. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that a student's perception of the hall as having real political power influences their decision to vote. Also, the research confirmed the significant role of candidate manifestos in shaping student voting preferences. Students consistently report prioritizing candidates whose platforms address issues of direct relevance to their daily lives within the hall, such as accommodation quality, welfare services, social activities, and security. The perceived clarity, feasibility, and alignment of candidate promises with student needs are key drivers of voter choice. Candidates who effectively articulate a vision for improving hall life and demonstrate a clear understanding of student concerns are more likely to garner support. In addition to this, a student's understanding of the manifesto has a direct impact on a candidate's electability. Students tend to veer towards a manifesto they can understand, and what is clear to them. The findings highlighted the need for targeted interventions to bridge the gap between general political awareness and local electoral engagement, foster a more vibrant political culture within halls, and encourage candidates to develop and communicate clear, relevant, and actionable manifestos. Practical recommendations for enhancing student political participation include targeted voter education campaigns that emphasize the importance of hall governance, initiatives to promote dialogue and debate
on key issues, and strategies for strengthening the link between hall government and student needs. Ultimately, this research aims to promote a more engaged, informed, and representative student community within halls of residence, thereby contributing to the development of future civic leaders.",Very relevant to Nigeria’s democracy: shows disconnect between political awareness and actual voting.

society at large and children in particular, the increasing concern about the
excessive use of social media remains an issue of academic discourse.
Premised on this, a study was undertaken on Nigerian mothers. The aim of
this study was to ascertain the rationale for mothers’ involvement in social
media use with their children, specifically on Facebook, X, and Instagram.
An online questionnaire was adopted from Ryan et al. (2019) to obtain data
from a purposively selected sample of 384 mothers who served as
respondents. Data was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social
Sciences (SPSS) version 21. Results indicated a significant relationship in
social media use between mothers and children, and that mothers
predominantly use WhatsApp for several purposes. Findings further
indicated mothers’ preference of conversation pattern to conformity pattern
of interaction with their children. The study concluded that social media
serves as a platform that helps in sustaining the bond between mothers and
their children. It, however, recommended the moderate use of social media
that is briskly supplanting physical mother-child interaction.",Locally relevant in Nigeria where WhatsApp is dominant.

on Children’s Education in Ilorin Metropolis, Kwara State Nigeria. The general purpose of this
study was to critically examine practitioners’ and parents’ perception of parent-teacher
partnership on children’s education in terms of communication, involvement in homework,
volunteering and decision making in Ilorin Metropolis.
The study employed the Explanatory mixed-method design, the purpose of this design was to
create a synergy between the qualitative and quantitative results. The study sample size was
420 and the stratified sampling technique was adopted for the quantitative method to select 400
respondents, while simple random sampling was used for qualitative method to select 20
participants. The instruments for data collection were two questionnaires titled ‘Practitioners’
Perception of Parent-Teacher Partnership Questionnaire 1 (PPPTPQ 1)’ and ‘Parents’
Perception of Parent-Teacher Partnership Questionnaire 2 (PPPTPQ 2)’ and two interview
guides titled ‘Interview guides for Practitioners’ on their Perception of Parent-Teacher
Partnership’ and ‘Interview guides for Parents’ on their Perception of Parent-Teacher
Partnership’. The reliability of PPPTPQ 1 yielded reliability coefficient of 0.88 and PPPTPQ 2
yielded reliability coefficient of 0.93 using Cronbach Alpha technique.
Two research questions and five hypotheses were generated for the study. Independent samples
t-test was used to test the null hypotheses at 0.05 level of significance. The findings of the study
revealed that communication is perceived as the most important means of parent-teacher
partnership in Ilorin metropolis. In addition, one of the findings of the study also revealed that
involvement in home work is perceived as the second important means of partnership between
parents and teachers. The result indicated a significant difference between practitioners and
parents perception (t = 2.197; df= 397; P < 0.05), no significant difference between the male
and female practitioners perception (t = 0.34; df = 198; P> 0.05), there is significant difference between public and private practitioners (t = -2.32; df = 197; P< 0.05), no significant difference between male and female parents (t = -0.10; df = 197; p > 0.05) and parents whose children attend private schools and those who attend public schools (t = 0.29; df = 197; p> 0.05). Based on the findings of the study, it was concluded that communication is perceived to be the most important means of partnership between parents and teachers, as it was discovered to have the highest mean value while volunteering is considered to be the least perceived means of patent-teacher partnership as it has the lowest mean value. The following recommendations were made: Parents, practitioners and other relevant stakeholders need to understand the importance of parent-teacher partnership, this will help them choose the type of partnership that is more appropriate and safe for the parent and the teacher.

Attempt was made to know what adult education has done and can do to stop the inhuman practice of Female Genital Mutilation that is deeply entrenched in the culture of the people. It employed the survey research design and oral interview as well as open and closed questionnaire items.100 respondents were randomly selected in the area under investigation.Data collected was analysed using simple percentages and frequency counts. Results from the study showed that a large percentage of the people have been mutilated. It further showed that awareness about the practice is high due to literacy and media sensitization although a large percentage are equally unaware of the legal implications of mutilating their children. Furthermore acquisition of literacy skills has helped in the reduction of female genital mutilation and provided access to information about the health implications of the procedure as well as help to forestall future occurrences. Based on the findings, it was recommended that girl child education be encouraged and subsidized, non-formal education should be encouraged. Mass mobilization should be used to enhance participation in literacy education programme. The male folk should be educated and encouraged to join anti-FGM campaign.

scientific concepts cannot be over-emphasized in the field of science education. Textbooks like every other instructional material occupy a significant place in the teaching-learning process. This study was carried out to identify and analyze analogies used in solving students’ misconceptions related to organic chemistry in some selected textbooks used in Nigerian secondary schools. In this study, five selected Chemistry textbooks were examined using descriptive analysis method to determine the types of analogies used in the textbooks. Analogies identified were classified in line with a classification scheme that was modified by Olayemi (2021). Criteria such as Presentation format, Nature of Shared Attributes, Position of analogue to the target, Abstraction, Level of enrichment, Use of the term analogy and Limitation were examined. The selected analogies in the textbooks were taken to the researcher’s supervisor for scrutiny and approval. The pro forma developed were given to experts in the field of science education and physical science (two chemistry lecturers and one chemistry teacher) to determine the relevance and appropriateness. Four research
questions were raised and answered. Data gathered were analyzed using frequency counts, percentages and bar chart to show the degree of relevance and appropriateness of the identified analogies by the raters.

This study assessed science teachers’ level of awareness and perception of analogies in secondary school classrooms in Ilorin, Nigeria. The sample comprised 80 science teachers obtained across 34 secondary schools using the convenience sampling technique. A researcher-designed questionnaire titled, “Science Teachers’ Awareness and Perception of Analogies” with a reliability coefficient of 0.82, was used for gathering data. Frequency, percentages, and mean were used to describe the responses, while Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to test the null hypotheses at a 5% level of significance. The findings revealed that the participating science teachers were highly aware of the nature of analogy and had a positively high perception of analogy use. There was no significant difference between science teachers’ awareness and perception of analogy based on their teaching experience.
